# Pineapple Electric SQLite RxStorage for RxDB

This package contains plugins for RxDB which store RxDocuments in SQLite.

This package is not written by, approved by or affiliated with Daniel Meyer or
the RxDB team. Please do not contact RxDB for help with this software.

## Usage

Because vite (or rollup) does not play nicely with `better-sqlite3`, please
include `better-sqlite3` as a dependency or devDependency in any project that
uses pe-sqlite-for-rxdb.
